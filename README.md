SPlot - Scala 2d Plotting library
=================================

_Splot_ This is a poor-man replacement of great [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python library for Scala.

It can plot line plots, scatter plots and arbitrary closed polygons. To start using it first import relevant classes and objects
```scala
import com.roche.genia.mlarki.plot._
```
